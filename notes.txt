partial dynamic typing. var type is saved in struct, must declare as a certain var, 
	but this can be modified later if needed.
methods can be added to certain types to concat strings etc.

struct to hold all types, has this format:
{
	type: '1'
	value: 
}
all types are a struct, they contain type info saved as well as the value


all arrays are linked lists. arrays can hold all types
	Array `variable name` = Array().
Array push pop etc methods.
"at" method allows you to put in index and return value. 

Automatic garbage collection. all major variables get pushed to this array automatically.

Class variable implementation????
	custom methods are saved in a linked list!
	prewritten function finds proper method

Arrow Functions!

Log function!
